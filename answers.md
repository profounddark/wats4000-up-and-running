# Priod to Building
1. What directories do you see? How do you interpret their names? *There appear to be three major file types: JavaScript (.js) files, JSON (.json) files, and what I assume to be Vue code/script (.vue) files.*
2. Where is the Vue app defined? (Which file?) *The index.html does not seem to contain anything substantive other than the "app" id tag. It appears that the bulk of the application is actually in the "App.vue" file, located in the src folder. It is worth mentioning that the vue.config.js file appears to have considerable information about how the app will be built (including the build location and the location of all of the assets).*
3. What is listed in `package.json`? *This file appears to define the contents of the rest of the files (the package). It includes the name of the app ("up-and-running") and the version (0.10). It also describes the dependencies of the app (in this case, the vue libraries 2.5.21) and the scripts needed to run and build the app.*
# After Building
1. What is in the node_modules directory? *The node_modules folder contains all of the code for the frameworks and systems that the app was built on. This includes Vue and everything Vue uses (such as Babel and other libraries).*
2. Where can you find the directions for the scripts run with `npm run`, that is the `serve` and `build` scripts. *They are part of the Vue CLI Service. Instructions for using them can be found on the official website at https://cli.vuejs.org/*
3. What's the difference between the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` object in the package.json file? *One could assume that this has to do with all of the things that are need to test an app made in Vue. When you're developing the app, you'll need X, Y, and Z (devDependencies) in addition to W (dependencies). But, when you deploy the final app, you only need W (dependencies).*
4. Explore the `docs` directory. What do you see? *This is the actual output application. Basically, all fo the Vue and whatnot gets converted into a HTML5/JS/CSS webpage. This would be what we'd use when we actually deploy the app to our server for people to access.*
5. Do you see the filenames of the static files? What seems odd about those filenames? *The file names are unreadable: essentially just a series of letters and numbers.*
6. Do you see the contents of your JS and CSS files? What has happened to those contents? *It appears that they have been "minified," insomuch that all of the extra space and end-of-line codes have been removed. It's basically unreadable.*
7. Three config files have been supplied for you: `vue.config.js`, `aliases.config.js` and `.babel.config.js`. What is the general purpose of each file. *`vue.config.js` looks like it gives direction as to where files in the app are stored, where the final app should be built, and other directives involving the compiling process. `aliases.config.js` looks to be direction on where certain aliases will direction to. For example, in this case, both @ and @src direct to the src folder. I imagine this is to ensure that everything is going to the correction location for their files. The `.babel.config.js` file appears to be a configuration file for Babel, the transpiler. In this case, it tells Babel what source is being compiled into JavaScript (in this case, Vue).*
8. Describe (in words and with a flowchart/diagram) what happens when the `npm run build` command is executed to the best of your ability.  *The package manager (npm) executes the build script for the application. I presume that it goes through the different pieces of the app in the public and src folders, converts them into HTML, JS, and CSS (as appropriate) and merges them into the appropriate files. During this process, it also minifies the files (removes spaces, line feeds, etc). The net result (in this case) is a static website (deposited in the docs folder).

9.  Make a diagram of the components of this system like the ones shown in the Practical JavaScript 2: Building Applications book `Types of Website Architectures`. Do your best to document your interpretation of the architecture of this system. *Looking at the app that came out of this, it looks like it's just a static website. That means that the Static Website diagram is most applicable here, but with some changes.*
